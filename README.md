# Sign language digits classification using pytorch
### ***[Ahmed Karam Youssef](https://twitter.com/ahmedevelop)***

You will find notebook explain how to train model that can recognize the digits, that can be useful with people can't take
maybe add the alphabet(soon) or we can use it in IOT with device make some functions depending on the sign you give it.

## what you need to run the notebook

clone the repo on your device if you have GPU NIVDIVA and you must have anaconda to run jupyter notebook or 
make it easy and clone it with google colab https://colab.research.google.com/ , that provide free GPU you can use it 
just from edit notebook settings choose GPU and run the code 

! git clone git@github.com:AhmedKYoussef/Sign-Language-Digits-pytorch-model.git 
and have fun and feel free to discovre the deep learning and pytorch framework.

### In this repo I used dataset from kaggle that (in data folder) that contain LICENSE check it if you want
